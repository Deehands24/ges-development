# Domain Due Diligence Checklist

**How to vet domains for SEO history, backlink profile, and trademark issues before buying.**

## Why Domain Due Diligence Matters

Before acquiring any domain for your digital real estate portfolio, thorough vetting is essential. A domain with a clean history can accelerate your time-to-rank; one with penalties or spam history can set you back months.

This checklist covers the critical checks we run on every domain before acquisition.

## Step 1: Check Domain History & Age

**Tools:** Archive.org Wayback Machine, Whois lookup

### What to Look For:
- Domain age (older = more authority potential)
- Previous ownership changes
- What content was hosted historically
- Any major gaps in usage (red flag for drops/penalties)

### Red Flags:
‚ùå Recently expired and re-registered
‚ùå Previously used for spam, adult content, or pharma
‚ùå Frequent ownership changes

### Green Flags:
‚úÖ Consistent ownership over years
‚úÖ Related niche content historically
‚úÖ Aged domain (5+ years)

## Step 2: SEO History & Backlink Profile

**Tools:** Ahrefs, Semrush, Moz

### Metrics to Check:
- **Domain Authority (DA/DR):** 20+ is decent, 40+ is strong
- **Referring Domains:** Quality over quantity
- **Anchor Text Distribution:** Natural mix (not over-optimized)
- **Spam Score:** Under 5% (Moz) or "Low" (Ahrefs)

### Red Flags:
‚ùå Sharp traffic drops (Google penalty)
‚ùå Spammy backlinks (casino, pharma, adult)
‚ùå Unnatural anchor text ratios (80%+ exact match)
‚ùå High spam score

### Green Flags:
‚úÖ Steady or growing backlink profile
‚úÖ Links from real sites in related niches
‚úÖ Natural anchor distribution

## Step 3: Google Penalties & Indexing

**Tools:** Google Search Console (if transferrable), Manual search

### How to Check:
1. Search: `site:yourdomain.com` in Google
2. Check if pages are indexed (or de-indexed)
3. Look for "This site may be hacked" warnings
4. Review Search Console for manual actions (if available)

### Red Flags:
‚ùå No pages indexed (penalty or sandbox)
‚ùå Manual action warnings in GSC
‚ùå Security warnings in search results

### Green Flags:
‚úÖ Clean indexing
‚úÖ No manual actions
‚úÖ Historical ranking data visible

## Step 4: Trademark & Legal Check

**Tools:** USPTO.gov, Trademarkia, Google search

### What to Check:
- Is the domain name trademarked?
- Are there active businesses using this exact name?
- Any cease-and-desist history?

### Red Flags:
‚ùå Active trademark (especially in your niche)
‚ùå Well-known brand name
‚ùå Legal disputes in domain history

### Green Flags:
‚úÖ Generic or descriptive term
‚úÖ No active trademarks in your space
‚úÖ Clean legal history

---

## Step 5: Technical Health

**Tools:** Screaming Frog, GTmetrix, SSL checkers

### Technical Checklist:
- [ ] SSL certificate available/renewable
- [ ] No malware or blacklist flags
- [ ] DNS propagates correctly
- [ ] No redirect chains or loops
- [ ] Mobile-friendly (if content exists)

## Step 6: Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Questions to Ask:
1. **Acquisition cost vs. building new:** Is the premium worth it?
2. **Time to monetization:** Will existing authority shorten timeline?
3. **Risk level:** How much cleanup will be required?
4. **Exit potential:** Could you flip this for 20-40√ó monthly revenue?

### Our Rule of Thumb:
- **Clean domain, strong DA, good niche:** Worth 3-10√ó annual revenue
- **Some cleanup needed:** Discount 30-50%
- **Major penalties/spam:** Walk away (build new instead)
